Unzip testcsvs.zip to a directory.  Run datacombiner.py in the directory you unziped the archive to or add the path where you unziped the file as a parameter.  When you run the command, it will grab the first oxygen sensor file, heart rate sensor file and HRBRC sensor file and combine them into a new csv called combined_sorted.csv and save it in the directory you are running datacombiner.py
